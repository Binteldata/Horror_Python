# Horror_Python

The air hung heavy with the stench of damp earth and decay. A throbbing headache pulsed behind your eyes as you struggled to open them. Disoriented, you found yourself sprawled on a cold, hard surface. Panic surged through you as you realized you were bound at the wrists and ankles, the rough rope biting into your skin. Memories flickered back - a deserted gas station late at night, a flickering neon sign, a shadowed figure approaching... then darkness. You were trapped, alone, and at the mercy of something unseen. But a faint glimmer of hope flickered in the distance. A single flickering candle cast an eerie glow on a dusty wooden chest a few feet away. As you strained to hear, a raspy voice echoed from somewhere in the inky blackness. "Welcome, little traveler. Your escape awaits, but there's a price. Make your choice..." 


* **Left: Open the chest.**  The voice chuckles, a cold, slithering sound. "Curious... very well." 
* **Right: Yell for help.**  Silence. The shadows seem to writhe in response, drawing closer. 
* **Stay Silent.**  The voice grows impatient. "Time is of the essence, little one. Choose!"
